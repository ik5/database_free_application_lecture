            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
              The following are few guidelines to better understand what I'm talking about:

              * An idea about breaking things into specific tasks:
                  Most applications try to do everything possible, even when there
                  are other tools for that.
                  Try to map such cases, and see how to break them into smaller 
                  applications

              * Thinking on what is important and what is not:
                  What does the tool actually require to do ?
                  Can Something prior to it can do some of the work ?
                  Can something after it can do some of the work ?
                  Can it call other tools to do some of the work ?

              * It's not about lack of data, but lack of database:
                  Think about specific POST or GET request at a web site.
                  Usually it's for one user, one screen, or one action.
                  It's never about the whole users, the whole tasks etc...

                  So imagine that I'll provide the information for a specific 
                  task, and that's all your code can do, handle such data.

                  When in need, request instructions, or report statuses.
                  But never try to access everything.

              * Understanding the PROs and CONS of each decision:
                  This system makes everything more simplified, but has few CONS 
                  arriving with it.
                  For example:
                   - You can never provide information like someone who store
                     statuses and information with databases.
                   - You must handle errors and not crash on them
                   - You must create your own protocol (data) on how to do things
                   - The other side must always understand and check things you report

            <h2>What is actor model ?</h2>
            <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
            <blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">
              The Actor model in computer science is a mathematical model of concurrent computation that treats "actors" as the universal primitives of concurrent digital computation: in response to a message that it receives, an actor can make local decisions, create more actors, send more messages, and determine how to respond to the next message received. The Actor model originated in 1973.[1] It has been used both as a framework for a theoretical understanding of computation, and as the theoretical basis for several practical implementations of concurrent systems.[2] The relationship of the model to other work is discussed in Indeterminacy in concurrent computation and Actor model and process calculi.
