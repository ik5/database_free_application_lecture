            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
              The following are few guidelines to better understand what I'm talking about:

              * An idea about breaking things into specific tasks:
                  Most applications try to do everything possible, even when there
                  are other tools for that.
                  Try to map such cases, and see how to break them into smaller 
                  applications

              * Thinking on what is important and what is not:
                  What does the tool actually require to do ?
                  Can Something prior to it can do some of the work ?
                  Can something after it can do some of the work ?
                  Can it call other tools to do some of the work ?

              * It's not about lack of data, but lack of database:
                  Think about specific POST or GET request at a web site.
                  Usually it's for one user, one screen, or one action.
                  It's never about the whole users, the whole tasks etc...

                  So imagine that I'll provide the information for a specific 
                  task, and that's all your code can do, handle such data.

                  When in need, request instructions, or report statuses.
                  But never try to access everything.

              * Understanding the PROs and CONS of each decision:
                  This system makes everything more simplified, but has few CONS 
                  arriving with it.
                  For example:
                   - You can never provide information like someone who store
                     statuses and information with databases.
                   - You must handle errors and not crash on them
                   - You must create your own protocol (data) on how to do things
                   - The other side must always understand and check things you report
